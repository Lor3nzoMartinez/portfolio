## Plug-in Overload
Well, it turns out there is a plugin for just about everything and yes there are also plugins for plugins. Trying to find the right plugins to install seems to be quite a task. There are just so many plugins! Now I know what you are going to say "Why don't you just use LazyVim and try some of those out" and I would say "That could work" BUT! I have dedicated to the path of Packer because I want to build MY version of NVIM not just play around with some of the setting in LazyVim. Thus, the hunt is on, what plugins will I use?

I just started with a few that I saw in LazyVim that I wanted in mine like `noice` for `notify` and as I am sure you are aware `LuaLine` from part 1 and `cyberdream` for the perfect theme duo. I also added `NeoTree` to help with navigation and buffer control. `Telescope` for some solid fuzzy finding and right now that's what I am playing around with once I start to find gaps and hear about new plugins we will have to figure out how to translate a LazyVim import to a Packer import ðŸ˜…
