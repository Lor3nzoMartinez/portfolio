## The Beginning
I’ve been a software developer for a while, but using Neovim (NVIM) for the first time made me feel like a complete beginner again. My journey with NVIM started out of curiosity and a desire to improve my efficiency. Day 1 was all about first impressions and humble beginnings. I installed NVIM and opened it, only to be greeted by an empty terminal screen and the blinking cursor. How do I even exit this thing? After a quick Google search, I learned the notorious `:q!` command to quit (a rite of passage for every Vim user).

## Motions and Precognition
Armed with a cheat sheet of basic Vim commands, I began practicing simple tasks: switching between Normal and Insert modes, saving a file with `:w`, and navigating text with h-j-k-l keys instead of arrow keys. It was awkward at first – I kept reaching for my mouse out of habit, only to realize NVIM is keyboard-centric. Each small victory, like successfully deleting a word without leaving the keyboard, felt rewarding. I also discovered precognition.nvim, a visual layer for some of the motion hints helps give me a hint of where some of the motions will take me.

## Quick start
By the end of that first day, I managed to edit and save a few test files and even enabled line numbers in the editor (my first tiny customization!). It wasn’t much, but it felt empowering. More importantly, I proved to myself that with patience and persistence, I could begin to tame NVIM’s learning curve. It was a challenging start, but I went to bed excited to continue the journey.
